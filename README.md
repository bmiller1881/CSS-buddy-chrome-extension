# Chrome Extension - CSS BUDDY

This extension can be used to quickly add borders to all of the elements of a webpage with the use of a hotkey (SHIFT + |). This is especially useful while actively working on layouts or inquiring about how other webpages were constructed. When in border-mode, links are disabled and the left-mouse button can be used to display the height and width properties of any element. 



**Icon (click to toggle on/off => SHIFT + |)**
